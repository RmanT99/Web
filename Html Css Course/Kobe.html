    <h1>About Kobe Bryant</h1>
    <p>
      For all of his statistical achievements
      <small
        >-- the five championships, the 81-point game, the 60-point finale, the
        league MVP in 2008, the 20 seasons all with the same franchise --
      </small>
      Bryant's lasting legacy is his mental edge and burning desire to master
      the sport. "Mamba mentality" became more than a kitschy catchphrase after
      Bryant died; it is now a blueprint for how to chase your dreams. He'll
      forever be on the short list of players you'd want to take the last shot
      with the game on the line. <br />
      -- Dave McMenamin
