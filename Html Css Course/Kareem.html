    <h1>About Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</h1>
    <p>
      No one in NBA history can match Abdul-Jabbar's lengthy list of
      achievements. He won a record six MVP awards and was a 19-time All-Star.
      He won six championships -- with the first and last coming 17 years apart
      -- and was named to 15 All-NBA teams, with 10 first-team selections. His
      unstoppable skyhook allowed him to score more points than anyone in league
      history, and while he wasn't flashy, there has arguably never been anyone
      better. <br />-- Bontemps
