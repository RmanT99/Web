    <h1>About Michael Jordan</h1>
    <p>
      <i>The greatest player of all time.</i> Jordan led the Bulls to six NBA
      championships, winning <em>six Finals MVP</em> awards and five
      regular-season MVP honors while becoming a global icon on and off the
      floor. Jordan's brilliance on both ends of the court defined a generation
      of basketball and set a new standard for players following in his
      footsteps. His game transcended the sport. <br />
