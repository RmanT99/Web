    <h1>About LeBron James</h1>
    <p>
      Standing 6-9 and weighing north of 250 pounds with a 40-inch vertical,
      James' game is built on power, but his passing ability might be his
      strongest skill. The four-time MVP and three-time champion has reinvented
      how an athlete's prime should be viewed; he had the Lakers in the thick of
      a title hunt as a 35-year-old playing in his 17th season. His chase-down
      block in Game 7 of the 2016 Finals to help complete a
      <mark>3-1 comeback against a Warriors team that won 73 games</mark> will
      forever encapsulate his will to win. <br />
      -- McMenamin
