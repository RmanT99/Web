    <p>
      <q>
        The greatest player of all time. Jordan led the Bulls to six NBA
        championships, winning six Finals MVP awards and five regular-season MVP
        honors while becoming a global icon on and off the floor. Jordan's
        brilliance on both ends of the court defined a generation of basketball
        and set a new standard for players following in his footsteps. His game
        transcended the sport.</q

    <p>
      Standing 6-9 and weighing north of 250 pounds with a 40-inch vertical,
      James' game is built on power, but his passing ability might be his
      strongest skill. The four-time MVP and three-time champion has reinvented
      how an athlete's prime should be viewed; he had the Lakers in the thick of
      a title hunt as a 35-year-old playing in his 17th season. His chase-down
      block in Game 7 of the 2016 Finals to help complete a 3-1 comeback against
      a Warriors team that won 73 games will forever encapsulate his will to
      win. <br />

    <h2 style="font-size: 200%">3- Kobe Bryant</h2>
    <img src="./assets/images/Kobe.jpeg" alt="Kobe Bryant" />
    <p>
      For all of his statistical achievements -- the five championships, the
      81-point game, the 60-point finale, the league MVP in 2008, the 20 seasons
      all with the same franchise -- Bryant's lasting legacy is his mental edge
      and burning desire to master the sport. "Mamba mentality" became more than
      a kitschy catchphrase after Bryant died; it is now a blueprint for how to
      chase your dreams. He'll forever be on the short list of players you'd
      want to take the last shot with the game on the line. <br />

    <h2 style="font-size: 200%">4- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</h2>
    <img src="./assets/images/Kareem.jpeg" alt="Kareem Abdul-Jabbar" />
    <p>
      No one in NBA history can match Abdul-Jabbar's lengthy list of
      achievements. He won a record six MVP awards and was a 19-time All-Star.
      He won six championships -- with the first and last coming 17 years apart
      -- and was named to 15 All-NBA teams, with 10 first-team selections. His
      unstoppable skyhook allowed him to score more points than anyone in league
      history, and while he wasn't flashy, there has arguably never been anyone
      better. <br />-- Bontemps

    <h2 style="font-size: 200%">5- Wilt Chamberlain</h2>
    <img src="assets/images/Wilt.jpeg" alt="Wilt Chamberlain" />
    <p>
      Chamberlain was truly ahead of his time. His numbers -- including scoring
      an NBA-record 100 points in a single game and averaging 50 points per game
      for an entire season -- are mythical. The only reason he doesn't rank
      higher on lists of the all-time greats is he won "only" two NBA
      championships. <br />-- Bontemps
