    <h1><b>About Wilt Chamberlain</b></h1>
    <p>
      Chamberlain was truly ahead of his time. His numbers -- including scoring
      an <strong>NBA-record 100 points</strong> in a single game and averaging
      50 points per game for an entire season -- are mythical. The only reason
      he doesn't rank higher on lists of the all-time greats is he won "only"
      two NBA championships. <br />-- Bontemps
